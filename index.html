    <h2>Abstract</h2>
    <p>
      We propose a new policy representation based on score-based diffusion models (SDMs).
      We apply our new policy representation in the domain of Goal-Conditioned Imitation Learning (GCIL) to learn
      general-purpose goal-specified policies from large uncurated datasets without rewards.
      Our new goal-conditioned policy architecture "<b>BE</b>bhavior generation with <b>S</b>c<b>O</b>re-based Diffusion
      Policies" (BESO) leverages a generative, score-based diffusion model as its policy.
      BESO decouples the learning of the score model from the inference sampling process, and, hence
      allows for fast sampling strategies to generate goal-specified behavior in just 3 denoising steps, compared to 30+ steps
      of other diffusion based policies.
      Furthermore, BESO is highly expressive and can effectively capture multi-modality present in the solution space of the
      play data. Unlike previous methods such as Latent Plans or C-Bet, BESO does not rely on complex hierarchical policies or additional
      clustering for effective goal-conditioned behavior learning. Finally, we show how BESO can even be used to learn a
      goal-independent policy from play-data using classifier-free guidance. To the best of our knowledge this is the first
      work that a) represents a behavior policy based on such a decoupled SDM b) learns an SDM based policy in the domain of
      GCIL and c) provides a way to simultaneously learn a goal-dependent and a goal-independent policy from play-data.
      We evaluate BESO through detailed simulation and show that it consistently outperforms several state-of-the-art
      goal-conditioned imitation learning methods on challenging benchmarks.
      We additionally provide extensive ablation studies and experiments to demonstrate the effectiveness of our method for
      effective goal-conditioned behavior generation.</p>
